# พิมพ์ไทยยาก Shift

A simple Thai typing game.

## Current word lists

* `words.json`: Generated by

    ```bash
    python3 filter.py raw/lexitron-utf8.txt -o data/words.json -r .3 -m 5
    ```
    
    The command above takes all words with at least 5 characters from the [LEXiTRON](http://www.sansarn.com/lexto/license-lexitron.php) word list, and then greedily removes low-shift words until the ratio of shift characters to all characterss exceeds 0.3.

## Planned word lists

* A list prioritizing low-frequency characters (currently a common character like "โ" and a rare one like "ฐ" have the same weight).
* Loan words from more obscure languages (e.g., foreign names, technical terms, religious terms).
* ภาษาสก๊อย
* Special characters (e.g., Thai numerals, mixing with English), though this might be untypable for some machines.
