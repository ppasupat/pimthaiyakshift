# พิมพ์ไทยยาก Shift

A simple Thai typing game.

## Current word lists

* `words.json`: Generated by

    ```bash
    python3 filter.py -o data/words.json -r .3 -m 5 -e .5
    ```
    
    The command above takes all words with at least 5 characters from the [PyThaiNLP](https://pythainlp.github.io/) word list,
    and then greedily removes low-shift words until the ratio of shift characters to all characterss exceeds 0.3. 
    Frequent shift characters count as 0.5 times other shift characters.

## Planned word lists

* Loan words from more obscure languages (e.g., foreign names, technical terms, religious terms).
* ภาษาสก๊อย
* Special characters (e.g., Thai numerals, mixing with English), though this might be untypable for some machines.
